      so you need to hire someone. like, <i>really need</i>. everything's five weeks behind schedule, and your boss is breathing down your neck, which is really strange, because he's shorter than you. he must be standing on a chair. and from some unearthly realm up bubbles a resume from one "Sean Gibat", and you think: "My god, this is the guy. I'm saved. My god. My god!" someone asks you nicely to stop screaming.

    <p class="content">
      well, you're right. I am the guy. I'm here to help you achieve your dreams. my dream is your dream, baby. let's get this party started. let's make you a bunch of money, and redistribute it to the poor. or whatever, reinvest in the business. we can do it all. bigly. bigly!!

      no but, seriously. listen. I'm the developer-person you need. I've got lots of good developer practice:
      <ul>
        <li>
          created a buncha project management tracking tools at <em>ITAC</em> (an engineering services firm) with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, and <strong>Backbone.js</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          taught young buckaroos <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Backbone.js</strong>, <strong>Angular.js</strong>, algorithms and other softare engineering fundamentals at <em>MakerSquare</em> (a Hack Reactor owned bootcamp)
        </li>
        <li>
          worked at <em>DataRobot</em> (they make a machine learning automation tool) doing all kinds of neat things
          <ul>
            <li>
              created a microservice to generate PNGs of graphs, CSVs of their data, and ZIPs of both. I first had to factor out the <strong>D3</strong> code from the existing state-based <strong>Angular</strong> directives into functional-style <strong>RequireJS</strong> modules. they had to be portable if I was going to use them on both the browser and the server. headless browser <strong>PhantomJS</strong> generated the actual graph using the D3 code, converted the graphs to PNG, and served requests (it has a webserver module). I tried to make the "PNGexport" microservice as functional as possible - Python code on the server sent over the data it needed rendered, PNGExport rendered it and returned a base64 string representation of the image. another Python class on the server generated CSVs of the data. every aspect of this was unit and integration tested.
            </li>
            <li>
              gained a heck ton of Data Science domain knowledge - a field I'm still pursuing as a hobby!
            </li>
            <li>
              worked with Data Scientists to document and implement best practice defaults and advanced option (non-default) validation
            </li>
            <li>
              lots of bug fixin'
            </li>
            <li>
              shoot what was that other thing?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
